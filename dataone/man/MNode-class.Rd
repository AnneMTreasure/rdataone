\title{MNode is a class representing a Member Node repository within the DataONE federation of data repositories.}
\description{
MNode provides functions interacting with the a DataONE Member Node repository, which
is a repository that provides access for reading and writing data and metadata using the common
DataONE service API.  The MNode API includes functions for retrieving data and metadata based on its
unique persistent identifier (pid), as well as for creating, updating, and archiving these data and
metadata objects.
}
\details{
Methods that perform write operations on the Member Node generally require
authentication, which is managed via a client-side X.509 certificate via
CILogon \url{https://cilogon.org/?skin=DataONE}.  See \code{\link{CertificateManager}} for details.
