createDataPackage(x, dataPackage, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{D1Client}

\item{dataPackage}{The DataPackage instance to be submitted to DataONE for creation.}

\item{...}{(not yet used)}
}
\description{
Creates the D1Objects contained in the DataPackage by calling the createD1Object()
on each of the members, as well as assembling the resourceMap object from the
recorded relationships, and calling create() on it as well.
Any objects in the data map that have a dataUploaded value are assumed to be
pre-existing in the system, and skipped.
}
\details{
The DataPackage describes the collection of data object and their associated
metadata object, with the relationships and members serialized into a document
stored under, and retrievable with, the packageId as it's own distinct object.

Members are created serially, and most errors in creating one object will
interrupt the create process for the whole, with the result that some members will
be created, and the remainder not.
