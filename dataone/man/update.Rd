\item{newpid}{The identifier of the new object to be created}

\description{
This method provides the ability to update a data or metadata object to the Member Node
provided in the \code{'mnode'} parameter.  In DataONE, both the original object and the new object are
maintained, each with its own persistent identifier, and the 'obsoletes' field in the SystemMetadata is
used to reflect the fact that the new object replaces the old.  Both objects remain accessible.
}
